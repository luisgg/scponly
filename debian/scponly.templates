_Description: Install the chrooted binary /usr/sbin/scponlyc SUID root?
 If you want scponly to chroot into the user's home directory prior to
 doing its work, the scponly binary has to be installed in
 /usr/sbin/scponlyc and has to have the suid-root-bit set.
 .
 This could lead (in the worst case) to a remotely exploitable root hole.
 If you don't need the chroot- functionality, don't install the file.
